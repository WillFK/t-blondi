# T-BLONDI

Youtube data scraper.

## SETUP

- install node.js (windows, mac, linux...);
- install dependencies by runnig: `npm i puppeteer `;
- run the program: `node blondi.js [your query here]`;
- the output (csv files) will be available inside the `output` folder, and it will be named `{you query}.csv`.

## PARAMETERS

It's is possible to choose the amount of channels you want to scrap. You can also apply some filters to your query. To do so, follow these steps:

- at project level, create a file called `properties.json`;
- the content of the file should follow this template:
```
{
    "minChannelAmount" : 10,
    "minSubscriptions" : 0,
    "maxSubscriptions" : 0,
    "minTotalViews" : 0,
    "maxTotalViews" : 0,
    "minAvgRecentViews" : 0,
    "maxAvgRecentViews" : 0
}
```

- `minChannelAmount`: the amount of channels the script should scrap;
- `minSubscriptions`: will ignore channels with fewer subscritions than this value;
- `maxSubscriptions`: will ignore channels with more subscritions than this value;
- `minTotalViews`: will ignore channels with fewer total views than this value;
- `maxTotalViews`: will ignore channels with more total views than this value;
- `minAvgRecentViews`: will ignore channels with fewer average recent views than this value;
- `maxAvgRecentViews`: will ignore channels with more average recent views than this value.

The script will ignore any filter for which the value is set to 0.


## BLACKLIST

There are two way to blacklist channels and users, and they can be used at the same time.
If you want to blacklist by channel / user id, then:

- create a file called `blacklist.txt`;
- add the id of the channels you want to ignore to it, like:
```
UCkGthGTWjI2awl1pqCQRncQ
UCaYLBJfw6d8XqmNlL204lNg
ESLBRASIL
```

If you want to blacklist by channel / user link, then:

- create a file called `blacklist_links.txt`;
- insert the link of the pages you want to ignore to the file, like:
```
https://www.youtube.com/user/ThePhylol/
https://www.youtube.com/user/albertsunzheng/about
https://www.youtube.com/user/hastadpelis/about
```

## TEMPLATE

It's possible to provide a template for the output format. To do so:

- create a file `template.txt` inside the project's folder;
- in the file, insert the columns you expect. The values must be separated by a tab;
- run the script;
- the formatted output will be named `{you_query}_formatted.csv`.

These are the supported values so far:

`"Influencer", "subs_count", "view_count", "most_views_recent", "least_views_recent", "avg_view", "median_views", "about_link"`

If you provide a unsupported value, it will insert a empty String instead.

There's an sample file `sample.template.txt` available in case you'd like to see how's the template is supposed to look like.
